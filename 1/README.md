# Problem Set 1

It's time to put your skills to the test. This problem set focuses on using primitive data types, variables, and basic operators and functions.

## Getting Started

To get started, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository to store your code. When you're finished, clone my skeleton to get all of the starter code and instructions. Setup a remote to push your code to your repository instead of mine.

### Setup

1. Login to your GitHub account and create a new repository named `pset-1`.
2. In the terminal, navigate to your `APCSA` directory on the `Desktop`.
```
$ cd ~/Desktop/APCSA
```
3. Clone my skeleton repository into a directory named `pset-1`.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:ap-java-ucvts/pset-1-skeleton.git pset-1
```
4. Change into your newly created `pset-1` directory.
```
$ cd pset-1
```
5. Overwrite the remote, which originally points at my skeleton repository.
```
$ git remote rename origin upstream
```
6. Add a new remote that points at your `pset-1` repository. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual username.
```
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/pset-1.git
```
7. Open up the `ProblemSet1.java` file in the text editor of your choice.

That's a lot of comments. Read each one carefully, as they are designed to point you in the right direction for each exercise.

## Exercises

The specifications for each exercise are outlined below. Unlike last time, there's is almost no code written for you. Your job is to write lines of code to produce answers to my questions. Your code must meet the requirements set forth in this section (as well as the *Deliverables* section).

Work through these exercises on your own. Experiment, make mistakes, ask questions, and fix your mistakes. It's the only way to get good at programming.
